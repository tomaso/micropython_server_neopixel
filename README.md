# Warning

The code is not very generic (hardcoded number of leds in my strip)
nor very robust (dies on exceptions and does not start over).

The SSID and wifi password needs to be provided before uploaded to pico w.

Use 'thonny' to save/upload the code to pico w (when the uf2 with micropython is
already there).
